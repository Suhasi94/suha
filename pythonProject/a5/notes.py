* give example of two if condition while explaning elif so that y elif is used will be understood in better way

while:

"""take even odd example using just if condition ...take start and end and use while loop
    example:

start = 1
end = 10
while start <= end:
    if start % 2 == 0:
        print("even")
    else:
        print("odd")
    start += 1
1.when we dont know how many number of iteration to be done than we use while loop
2.manually increment/decrement the reference variable.

3. in loop if break statement is not executed only than else block will be executed in the while and for loop
    ex:
  while condition:
      if condition:
          break
  else:
      print(will be executed wen break is not encountered at all)
4. while loop can be applied only through sequence (which can be indexed)
    thats why we cannot use while loop for sets and dictionaries
    
"""
* for loop:
range(start,end,step)# end is mandatory,end is not inculed if u want till 10 take till 11
range is an inbuilt method
"""

for loop: used wen number of iterations to be done is known
1. there is no need to keep track of iteration as for loop does it implicitly
2. no need to increment the reference variable manually
